## Trivia

    **Question 1** From which country does the arabica coffee originates. Java(Indonesia), Ethiopia, Brazil, Columbia, Yemen

Ethiopia is the birthplace of arabica coffee, meaning that at some point in time it was only naturally found here as wild plants.

At some point in time a coffee plant was brought from Ethiopia to Yemen and it become very popular as a drink there. The earliest records are from 15th century, Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.

From there is spread to the entire muslim world. The name 'Arabica' came from the beans' connection to Arabia, where it first gained popularity.
In meantime coffee drink was against the law in Ethiopia.

At the beginning of 1500 the Otoman popularized the coffee in Europe.

The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from the Arabic qahwah. The word qahwah most likely meant 'the dark one', referring to the brew or the bean. 

    **Question 2** How many wild variaties of arabica are in Ethiopia? Less than 1k, 1k-5k, 6k-10k, Over 10k.
    There are between six and ten thousand coffee varieties in Ethiopia. Due to this colossal figure, there hasn’t been enough genetic testing to allow buyers to distinguish one from another. With the cross-pollination that occurs naturally in the wild, the name ‘Ethiopian Heirloom’ exists as an umbrella term to describe all variants.

The race among Europeans to obtain live coffee trees or beans was eventually won by the Dutch in 1616. Pieter van den Broecke, a Dutch merchant, obtained/stole some plants of the closely guarded coffee bushes from Mocha, Yemen, in 1616. He took them back to Amsterdam and found a home for them in the Botanical gardens, where they began to thrive. This apparently minor event received little publicity but was to have a major impact on the history of coffee.

The plants adjusted well to conditions in the greenhouses at the Amsterdam Botanical Garden and produced numerous healthy Coffee arabica bushes. In 1658 the Dutch first used them to begin coffee cultivation in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and later in southern India, which were both abandoned for Java in Asia, Suriname in the Americas.

Within a few years, the Dutch colonies had become the main suppliers of coffee to Europe. The plants variety they use is called Typica.

    **Question 3** Espresso literally means: Speed up, To go, Forced out, Intense, Rapid
    In Italian, the word espresso literally means "forced out." And to make sure everyone is on the same page, the word is pronounced "es-press-o" not "ex-spress-o." 

French also started to cultivate the plant on the island of Bourbon(Now Reunion). Named after the drink it produced (Whiskey bourbon) especially the vanilla spiced one due to proximity to Madagascar.

The plant actually ended up mutating into a different variety and significantly changed from the Typica plant. One of the key differences is the productivity as the Bourbon plant is about 30% more productive than Typica. With this extra productivity, it became quite desirable, and the seeds of this new varietal were planted in different parts of Central & South America.

Bourbon is known for having a bit more complexity and sweetness in the taste profile, when compared to Typica.

In Brazil, a mutation of the bourbon plant resulted in a smaller, and even more productive version of this shrub. Since it was planted just outside of the town of Caturra, Brazil, the variety was given the name of cattura. The coffees’ taste tends to have a bright acidity with potentially less clarity than Bourbon.

    **Question 4** The country that drinks the most coffee is… Finland, Italy, America, Turkey, Greece
    The people of Finland consume the most coffee at 12.5 kilograms per person per year. Believe it or not, Finnish coffee drinkers sip nearly three times as much coffee than the average American.

There are few hybrids of Note.

* Mundo Novo is the result of a natural cross between the Bourbon and Typica varieties found in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
* Catuai is a cross between highly productive Mundo Novo and compact Caturra. The plant is highly productive compared to Bourbon, in part because of its small size, which allows plants to be closely spaced; it can be planted at nearly double the density.
* Timor is an interesting a variaty, because it is actually part Robusta and part Arabica. To contrast, every other variety we have discussed is 100% Arabica. With this brings some of Robusta’s characteristics to the bean, such as more of a bitter taste, more caffeine and more resistance to bugs.
* Catimor is part Caturra, and part Timor. As these cross-mixed varietals bring the best of both worlds of, they appealed to the farmers and have become immensely popular.

Fresh roasted beans have peak aroma 1-3 weeks and then they gradually loose the intensity. 3 months is another cutoff point with noticeable loss in taste. After 1.5 years they are still ok to drink but will loose most of the taste.

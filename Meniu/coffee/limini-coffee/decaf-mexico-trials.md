### Espresso - 12 bar opv, dose: 18g⁠

**1st Try**

* Grind Setting: 16
* Temp: 92°C - 15s heat, 4s steam
* Resulting coffee: 48g
* Brewing time:10s

Tasted overly bitter, although the quantity and timings would indicate under.  
We will decrease the temp, grind thinner and increase extraction quantity.

**2nd Try - Selected**

* Grind Setting: 15
* Temp: 88°C - 15s heat
* Resulting coffee: 48g
* Brewing time: 18
  
Still bitter but I can fell the sourness as well.It has a strong kick.

**3rd Try**

* Grind Setting: 12
* Temp: 88°C - 15s heat
* Resulting coffee: 40g
* Brewing time: 27s
  
The coffee feels like a darker roast than 3/5. Good with lattes and cappuccinos, less with macchiato.
This setting is the best so far but felt sour.

**4th Try - Selected**

* Grind Setting: 11.5
* Temp: 88°C - 10s heat
* Resulting coffee: 37g
* Brewing time: 26s

The best so far ... still sour. I don't think I can get an amazing coffee out of this.

**5th Try - Selected**

* Grind Setting: 11.5

# Recent Beans

It is a small company with two roasters one in Wakefield and one in Castleford. [Recent Beans Website](https://www.recentbeans.com)  

Pros:

* The quality of coffee bags is amazing, I feel confident to keep the coffee in them.
* Free 24h shipping with royal mail on orders over 7£. Which mean you can have a 250g subscription every 2 weeks without paying more.
* They tend to do darker roast for those who prefer it.

Cons:

* I tried a sample Ethiopian espresso at the Wakefield center and it was muddy (indicating problems with the brewing process)
* They could do a bit of better quality control, as few beans were not roasted properly.
* I would like more info on the blends such as origins and plants variety.


Tools we used:

* Coffee Grinder: MiiCoffee DF54
* Espresso machine: Gaggia Classic Evo (2024)
* Portafilter: OMS Gaggia Naked Portafilter
* Basket: IMS Barista Pro 20g

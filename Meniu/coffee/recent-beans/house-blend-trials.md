Origin: Unknown
Plants Variety: Unknown
Roast level: 4/5  
Tasting Notes: Chocolate, Toffee and Blackcurrant 

### Espresso - 12 bar opv, dose: 18g⁠

We tried the following temp surfing method:  
Preheat the machine for 15-20 min and flush the head until light goes off.  
Wait for the light again. From here we have some options:

* Press brew immediately ~ 85°C
* Wait 10s, then press brew ~ 88°C 
* Wait 10s, press steam for 5s, then press brew ~ 92°C
* Wait 10s, press steam for 5s, wait 5s, then press brew ~ 96°C

**1st Try**

* Grind Setting: 12
* Temp: 88°C
* Resulting coffee: 0g
* Brewing time:40s

It extracted nothing :). Grind was way too fine.

**2nd Try**

* Grind Setting: 15
* Temp: 88°C
* Resulting coffee: 30g
* Brewing time:28s

The extraction was all over the place, splashing everywhere.
Resulting coffee was over-extracted with a nice aroma.
We will coarsen the grind and increase the temperature.

**3rd Try - Selected**

* Grind Setting: 16
* Temp: 92°C
* Resulting coffee: 37g
* Brewing time: 25s

The extraction had a single spur at the end, but the rest was almost perfect.The taste had balanced flavours.  
Strong aroma coffee designed for milky drinks such as cappuccinos.
